### what is an Armstrong number?

An Armstrong number, also known as a narcissistic number, is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. For example, in the case of a three-digit number, if the sum of each digit raised to the power of three equals the number itself, then it is an Armstrong number. A classic example is 153, since 
<strong>1^3+5^3+3^3 =153.</strong>
